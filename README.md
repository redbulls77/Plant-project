# Plant-project
ICT Infrastructure project 

The project aims to create an automatic plant watering system. A sensor reads the soil moisture, and if it is too low, a pump activates to water the plant. Additionally, we will set up a virtual machine to create a database where we collect data on soil moisture as well as temperature and humidity data from the DHT11 sensor. We will connect the database to Grafana to visualize the data graphically.
